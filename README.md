# joining_our_waitlist_with_your_email
Created a website that has people to join on our waitlist by inputting their email. This is presenting how SQL database is connecting to Node.js from the website.
To run it,  Start the MySQL server before you run your node application. 
If you're using goormIDE or Linux-based system, enter "mysql-ctl start" or "service mysql start" (without the quotes) from the bash prompt (the one that starts: root@goorm:/workspace/).

If you're using a Mac, click on the MySQL icon, and the click on the "Start MySQL Server" button.

If you're using Windows, press the Start (Windows) key and type in "services" (without the quotes). In the window that opens, scroll down to the MYSQL80 service, select it, then start it.

Once you have the MySQL Server running, go back and run my node app.js, then refresh the web page that contains the running URL.
